Write a shell script like the "more" command. It asks the user name,
the name of the file on the command prompt and displays only the 15
lines of the file at a time on the screen. Further, the next 15 lines
will be displayed only when the user presses the enter key / any other
key.

CODE:

counter=1
echo "Enter file name: "
read file
 
if [ ! -f $file ]
then
	echo "$file is not a file!"
	exit 1
fi
 
exec 3<&0
while read line
do
	if [ $counter -eq 15 ]
	then
		counter=0 # reset counter
		echo "Press [Enter] button to get the next lines."
		read -u 3 enterKey
	fi
	echo $line
	(( counter++ ))
done < $file
